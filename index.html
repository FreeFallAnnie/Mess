        Why are we doing it? What are the goals?<br>
        What are the fundamental assumptions behind our work? Do we need to change them?<br>
        How does our value system shape our work and the final product?<br>
        How our priorities drive the design choices we make?<br>
        Are our motivations transparent and for the public good?<br>

        How can we share information more readily?<br>
